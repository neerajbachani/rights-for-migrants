# Database Migration Instructions

## Important: Complete the Database Setup

The database schema and TypeScript types have been set up, but the database migration needs to be completed. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Start the Database Server
```bash
npm run db:dev
```
This will start the local Prisma PostgreSQL server. Keep this terminal window open.

### Step 2: Run the Migration (in a new terminal)
```bash
npm run db:migrate
```
This will create the `form_submissions` table in your database.

### Step 3: Verify the Setup
```bash
npm run db:studio
```
This will open Prisma Studio where you can view your database tables.

## What Has Been Completed

✅ **Prisma Schema**: Created with FormSubmission model  
✅ **TypeScript Types**: All form-related interfaces in `lib/types/form.ts`  
✅ **Prisma Client**: Generated and configured in `lib/utils/prisma.ts`  
✅ **Database Utilities**: Helper functions in `lib/utils/formDatabase.ts`  
✅ **Package Scripts**: Added database management scripts to package.json  

## What Needs to Be Done

⏳ **Database Migration**: Run the migration to create tables  
⏳ **Test Connection**: Verify database connectivity  

## Files Created/Modified

- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema with FormSubmission model
- `lib/types/form.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for form operations
- `lib/utils/prisma.ts` - Prisma client configuration
- `lib/utils/formDatabase.ts` - Database operation utilities
- `package.json` - Added database management scripts
- `.env` - Database connection string (already existed)

## Next Steps

After completing the migration, you can proceed to implement the next task in the implementation plan: "2. Implement form submission API endpoint".
