# CTA Section Integration Test

## Test Plan for Form Submission Integration

### Test Cases

1. **Form Validation**
   - Empty fields should show validation errors
   - Invalid email format should show error
   - Long inputs should show character limit errors
   - Valid inputs should clear validation errors

2. **Form Submission**
   - Valid form should submit successfully
   - Loading state should be shown during submission
   - Success message should appear after successful submission
   - Form should reset after successful submission
   - Modal should close after success message timeout

3. **Error Handling**
   - Network errors should display error message
   - Rate limiting errors should be handled gracefully
   - Server errors should show appropriate feedback

4. **UI/UX Preservation**
   - All existing animations should work
   - Modal animations should remain unchanged
   - Button hover effects should work
   - Form styling should match existing design

### Manual Testing Steps

1. Open the application and navigate to the CTA section
2. Click "Join the Movement" button
3. Try submitting empty form - should show validation errors
4. Fill in invalid email - should show email validation error
5. Fill in valid data and submit - should show loading state, then success
6. Verify form resets and modal closes after success
7. Test network error handling by disconnecting internet during submission

### Expected Behavior

- Form validation works client-side before submission
- Loading states prevent multiple submissions
- Success/error messages are clearly displayed
- Form resets properly after successful submission
- All existing UI/UX elements remain unchanged
